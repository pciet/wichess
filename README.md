```wichess``` requires a PostgreSQL database matching the configuration you set in ```dbconfig.json```. The file ```postgres_tables.sql``` contains the SQL commands to create the necessary tables, and ```create_postgres_tables.sh``` may be configured to run the table create commands if you have ```psql``` installed.
