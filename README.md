Welcome to the source code for Wisconsin Chess!

The game of chess can enable both competition and the perception of metaphors for war, debate, dog training, or other endeavors with two-sided choice making, and chess is a good brain exercise. Chess was played and incrementally designed by generations of people through centuries and is often seen in art, and many people will play chess today.

This is my variation of chess which builds on the traditional modern pieces and rules while maintaining the predictability and abstraction that makes chess unique. Pieces start on the same squares, and castling, en passant, promotion, check, checkmate, and draws are included. If you want to learn chess or improve your skill then this game will help you do that.

Added are concepts from trading card games: players each have a collection of new pieces with new characteristics that can optionally replace the regular chess pieces. This addition causes new emergent scenarios that keep gameplay fresh and exciting.

## Status

Wisconsin Chess is a work in progress. It was inspired by one of the ideas I researched after quitting my tech job to persue solo entrepreneurship in spring 2014. Coding began partway through 2017 and a first version was completed by the start of 2018 (see the v0.1 git tag), but the project was shelved then.

During 2020 I've had the opportunity to work on it again. Version 0.2 is a massive improvement and is currently in an alpha state as I continue to make it more fun, unbreakable, and valuable.

Shortly I will have to shelve the project again because of lack of funds. If you or someone you know is interested in a funding partnership for this project I'd be happy to discuss such business details, or if you would like to freely contribute a small amount of money then buying my music at [matthewjuran.bandcamp.com](https://matthewjuran.bandcamp.com) is the best way to do that.

If you play Wisconsin Chess and find a mistake or think something should be better then any report is appreciated. Please [open an issue](https://github.com/pciet/wichess/issues) on GitHub for your feedback, and thanks.
