# WISCONSIN CHESS README

Welcome to the source code for Wisconsin Chess!

The game of chess has a history lasting centuries. This new variation of chess keeps that tradition with all modern rules; the pieces are the same (King, Queen, Bishop, Knight, Rook, Pawn) and castling, en passant, promotion, timers, and draws are there. 

Chess computation also has a history in aritificial intelligence and personal computer play. Wisconsin Chess is a variation that additionally leverages computation to enable army variations with optional replacement pieces that create new complex scenarios made simple by available moves being calculated for you.

In this document I'll show how to install the game and play it across a network using smartphones and personal computers, and I'll give an overview of the patterns you'll find in the source code. Credits for included libraries made by other people are at the bottom.
