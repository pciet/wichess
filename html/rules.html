<h1>Rules of Wisconsin Chess</h1>

<h2>Chess Variation</h2>

<p>
Wisconsin Chess is a chess variation. If you know chess then most of this game will be familiar.
If you don't know chess then you will learn it by playing Wisconsin Chess.
</p>

<h2>Players</h2>

<p>
Chess is a board game played between two people across from each other. One player controls the
white army and the other player controls the black army.
</p>

<p>
The person controlling the white army makes the first move. Chess is played as turns, so a player
makes a move then the other player makes a move which is repeated until the game is completed.
</p>

<h2>Board</h2>

<p>
The board is a grid of squares with eight rows and eight columns. Each person's army begins on the
16 squares of the two rows closest to them.
</p>

<p>
Each army is a set of pieces with varying ability. Each kind of piece has a name. The front row 
closer to the opponent is all <a href="/details?p=pawn">pawns</a> and the back row has a variety.
</p>

<h2>Moving Pieces</h2>

<p>
Every piece in the army can either move to empty squares or move to squares with an opponent 
piece. Each piece has a known set of moves it's allowed to do.
</p>

<p>
When a move is onto an opponent's piece then the move is called a capture. Capturing a piece takes
it off the board into the posession of the capturing player. Captured pieces no longer affect
the game.
</p>

<h2>The Kings</h2>

<p>
The object of chess is to capture your opponent's <a href="/details?p=king">king</a> piece. This
is called a checkmate when it happens.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quote">
"Mary won against Patricia with an unexpected checkmate early in the game."
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If a king could be captured the next turn then the king is said to be in check. Any of your moves
that cause your king to become in check are illegal. If your king is in check then the move you
make must cause the king to leave check.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quote">
"Jennifer has put Linda in check. There's only two moves that can be made, which should Linda
choose?"
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Checkmate is when a player's king cannot leave check. If a king is not in check but every move is
into check then the game is a draw.
</p>

<h2>Other Draws</h2>

<p>
Besides that case of not being in check but having no moves available, there are other reasons why
a game can be declared a draw.
</p>

<p>
If no pawns remain and the pieces on the board are too few to cause a checkmate then the game is
a draw.
</p>

<p>
If no pawn has moved and no captures have happened for a large number of turns then the game is
a draw.
</p>

<h2>Regular Chess Pieces</h2>

<p>
More rules are specific to individual pieces and sometimes their interactions with each other.
All of those rules are described on the details webpage for each piece. Here's a list of the
regular chess pieces.
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/details?p=king">King</a></li>
<li><a href="/details?p=queen">Queen</a></li>
<li><a href="/details?p=rook">Rook</a></li>
<li><a href="/details?p=bishop">Bishop</a></li>
<li><a href="/details?p=knight">Knight</a></li>
<li><a href="/details?p=pawn">Pawn</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Wisconsin Chess Additions to Chess</h2>

<p>
Wisconsin Chess adds special pieces that replace the regular chess pieces. Each special piece is
based on a regular piece and can only be placed onto a square that matches the basic kind it is.
</p>

<p>
Each player of Wisconsin Chess has a collection that has up to 21 special pieces. You can place
these into your army before starting a game. The collection stays the same unless you decide to
replace a piece.
</p>

<p>
A special piece is presented as a reward for completing a game. If you want it then you place
the piece into your collection.
</p>

<p>
When configuring the army before the game you are presented with two "random pick" pieces. These
two slots are two random special pieces. Until you use them in your army they stay the same. When
used in your army then the slot is replaced with a new piece. Like the reward piece, when you
complete a game you have the option of placing used random pick slot pieces into your collection.
