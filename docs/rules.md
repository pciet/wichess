# THE RULES OF WISCONSIN CHESS

Wisconsin Chess has optional special pieces that add to the rules of regular chess. Here I'll explain chess as I know it.

Chess is played on top of a flat grid board, the same board as checkers. There are eight rows and columns for a total of 64 squares. The colors of the squares on the board vary in a pattern. The square colors aren't used in chess.

Two players play against each other using pieces that are moved on the board in turns. On one side is the white army controlled by a player, and the other player controls the black army. A player only moves pieces in their army.
