I believe that computer information, such as the content of this source 
code repository at github.com/pciet/wichess, is a product of a tool similar 
to the printing press. No law of the United States congress can abridge the 
freedom of the press, and I believe this protection should also apply to 
computers. I will not try to use laws against free computer use of this 
code repository.
